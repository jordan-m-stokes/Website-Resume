                <p id="bio-paragraph">Born and raised in the Austin-area, I was raised diligent. In high school I competitively swam and I sang in choir, and tirelessly strived to program a 3D-Java-based game. I began coding at 15, and from line one, I loved it; inspired to create; to design. Now having worked the past few years for Malcom-Baldwidge Award winning restaurant operation, K&N Management, I am driven to be the best one can be. Meanwhile, I continue learning code, furthering my knowledge, seeking online certifications, notably my Treehouse Techdegree in full-stack JavaScript.</p>
