            <p id="bio-paragraph">Born and raised in the Austin-area, I was raised diligent. In high school I competitively swam and I sang in choir, and tirelessly strived to program a 3D-Java-based game. I began coding at the age of 15, and from the first line, I loved coding. I felt inspired to create; to design. Now having worked the past few years for a Malcom-Baldwidge Award winning restaurant operation (K&N Management), I have been pushed to be the best employee one can be. Meanwhile, continue learning to code at home, spending countless hours furthering my knowledge of programming, seeking online certifications, notably my “Techdegree” from Treehouse in full-stack JavaScript.</p>
